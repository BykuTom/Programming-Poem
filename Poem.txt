On JavaScript

In the infinite expanse of programming tongues so diverse,
One made me question my sanity - it was a hex on my universe!
I almost eloped with my computer, mouse, and monitor screen,
Caught up in the mind-bending maze of Javascript, obscene and mean

I tried to make sense of its curly braces and semicolons,
But my code kept breaking, and I couldn't find what was wrong.
I tried to console.log() my way out of the mess,
But it seemed like every time, my program became less.

My functions were named with such care and precision,
Yet every time I updated them, I sparked a new collision.
And though I tried to be diligent and pay attention,
My code always ended up with an unexpected exception.

But still I persisted, I couldn't give in,
I had to figure out this language, it was my original sin.
And though the journey was fraught with frustration and tears,
I finally found the solution, and my program ran without fears.
