In the infinite expanse of programming tongues so diverse,
One made me question my sanity - it was a hex on my universe!
I almost eloped with my computer, mouse, and monitor screen,
Caught up in the mind-bending maze of Javascript, obscene and mean

I tried to make sense of its curly braces and semicolons,
But my code kept breaking, and I couldn't find what was wrong.
I tried to console.log() my way out of the mess,
But it seemed like every time, my program became less.
